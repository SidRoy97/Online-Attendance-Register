Facial recognition technology is used by thisÂ web-based attendance system to automate attendance taking and guarantee accurate records.

The face_recognition library is used in the backend system to recognize student photos, making it possible to take attendance by submitting a group photo. The faces in the picture are identified by the library, which then gets the relevant information and displays it on the webpage. Furthermore, the system logs this data into the database for that particular classroom, offering a precise and effective way to monitor attendance.
